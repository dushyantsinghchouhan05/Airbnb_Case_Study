# Airbnb_Case_Study

Analysis done Airbnb -


**
Conclusion**
The data indicates that 'Michael' is the top list person to give profits.
The rates of the room are mostly low but better reviews.
The most of the travelor takes the Entire home/apa and private as compared to shared room because some of people like new person to share his time.
Here Manhattan and Brooklyn are the top neighbour where the host make their house list here and can be the perfect place for the people because this are located near sea so this can be perfect spot to stay.
As per my analysis the prices which are low were given more ratings as compare to hig prices
At last my personal opinion there must be more data to go in depth of this data set.
Thanks! may this visualization can enough to understand about the dataset of AirBnb New York City.
